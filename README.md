# House_price_Prediction

Developed a Bangalore House Price Prediction model leveraging machine learning techniques to forecast property prices in the region. Performed comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing, handling missing values and encoding categorical features to ensure data quality.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of house prices and identify influential factors such as location, size, amenities, and neighborhood characteristics.

Utilized regression algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression to build predictive models. Employed cross-validation techniques for model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for optimization.

Achieved accurate price predictions with the Random Forest Regression model, demonstrating a deep understanding of real estate market dynamics and effective modeling techniques.

This project showcases expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling, offering valuable insights for real estate stakeholders and investors in Bangalore.
